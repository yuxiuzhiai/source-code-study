ReferenceCounted

接口定义

	一个ReferenceCounted对象需要明确的释放
	当初始化一个ReferenceCounted对象后,它的起始count是1,#retain()会增加count(),#release()会降低count
	如果count下降到0,这个对象就会被重新分配

接口定义

	public interface ReferenceCounted {
	
	    int refCnt();

	    ReferenceCounted retain();

	    ReferenceCounted retain(int increment);
